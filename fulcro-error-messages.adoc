== Common Fulcro Error Messages

Fulcro is complicated and things need to line up correctly for
everything to work.

* Is the data in your database?
* Is the data getting from your db to your root component, form or
report?
* Is the data getting from root to your child components?

=== Can't refresh your Fulcro project

fulcro-template and fulcro-RAD-demo contain *.cljc files which contain
both clj and cljs expressions. It can be tricky to get cljc files to
refresh correctly using clojure's namespace refresh tools.

One approach is to avoid using cljc files if possible. This is not
always possible so another approach is to visit the development.clj
file, load the file in the repl and call the (start) function. This
bypasses clojure.tools.namepace/refresh and you should be back up and
running again.

Setting the variable `set-refresh-dirs` is supposed to solve the problem
but I have done that in fulcro-template/src/dev/user.clj and the problem
still occurs.

=== "Cannot Load item in Repl"

Make sure you have the correct repl setup (CLJS or CLJ) and that the
right repl is the one receving input.

=== Objects are not valid as a React child

This can happen when you pass a parameter to a react component that it
doesn't know how to render. In many cases this could mean that you're
passing a clojurescript keyword to a react compoment.

Try removing any symbol that may be a non-renderable object and
re-render.

Also, you can turn keywords into strings with `name` e.g.:

[source,clojure]
----
(name :somekeyword) => ":somekeyword"
----

=== No such var: â€¦ macro-create-element*

This can be due to a cljc file that has does not use #?(clj: ) to
separate the namespaces "dom" and "dom.server".

To fix, add the following to the namespace that is producing the error:

[source,clojure]
----
#?(:clj  [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.dom-server :as dom :refer [div p a]]
   :cljs [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.dom :as dom :refer [div p a]])
----

=== When defining a mutation "no source by provide: app.ui.root"

Calling a mutation directly? Do you have to use `transact!`?

=== Shadow-cljs fails to load after change (Missing Root query)

This could be caused by many things but the issue that I run into is not
specifying a query for root when other components in the chain have
queries defined. This will prevent shadow-cljs from compiling and it
will send the browser into an infinite loop.

Update: Fulcro-3.4.19 should warn you about this case

=== Recommended steps for building a fulcro app

==== If the data is already in an established DB

* Create the resolvers and make sure that your resolvers return your
data in the correct shape (or format).
* Create simple reports first with resolvers that you know are working.
Once you have the base working, start enhancing the resolvers and ui.
